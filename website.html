        <p>I am a first-year PhD candidate at Cornell Computer Science. 
        My research is in Programming Languages. </p>

        <p>Before Cornell, I was a research assistant for <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hobor/">Aquinas Hobor</a>. Our main
        project was a Coq development eases the formal verification of graph-manipulating algorithms written in C. Fun highlights include a verified garbage collector for the CertiCoq compiler and the discovery of an overflow bug in Dijkstra's algorithm. </p>

        <p>Before Aquinas, I was part of the amazing inaugural cohort of <a href="https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/">Yale-NUS College</a>. I had the honor of giving the commencement speech for my graduating class, and serve on the Alumni Council. </p>

        <p> The Ackermann function \(\mathcal{A}\) grows explosively, and its inverse
          \(\alpha\) is of interest in CS. Sadly, the standard practice of computing 
          \(\alpha\) via \(\mathcal{A}\) is untenable.
          We give a new and efficient computation of \(\alpha\). 
          We also give efficient computations for the 
          related and better-known hyperoperation hierarchy 
          (\(+\), \(\times\), exp, tetration, etc) and <em>its</em> inverse
          (\(-\), \(\div\), log, log\(^{*}\), etc).
          Our definitions are proved correct in Coq, 
          and our timebounds are benchmarked after extraction to OCaml. </p>

        <p> The formal verification of graph algorithms is hard: nodes can be shared
          arbitrarily, making it hard to "frame away" the uninvolved parts of a graph.
          We tackle this issue via a new <span class="sc">localize</span> rule, 
          develop an extensible Coq library to further ease 
          such verifications, and use the library to verify seven 
          graph algorithms written in C. Our flagship example is a 
          generational garbage collector.
          We identify two places where the semantics of C is too restrictive to define 
          OCaml-style GCs.
          Our proofs are checked in Coq. </p>

        <p> CertiCoq compiles Gallina into C;
          the transition from an infinite heap to a 
          finite one is supported by garbage collection 
          at the C level. 
          We get into the weeds of the verfication of this GC, 
          showing how the correctness property&mdash;a form of
          graph isomorphism&mdash;is broken and recovered.
          In two places, we find that the semantics of C 
          are too restrictive to define the 
          behavior we need. We suspect these restrictions 
          will ail future verifications of OCaml-style GCs. 
          

<!-- Interestingly, our verification exposes two places where the semantics of C do not allow the formal specification and verification of OCaml-style GCs such as ours.

          and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things">The God of Small Things</a>,
          which worked nicely as a tragicomedy soup. 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sometimes_a_Great_Notion">Sometimes a Great Notion</a>
          has recently barged into these ranks. The meaning of this is as yet unclear. </p>

        <p> <a href="https://thememorypalace.us/if-you-have-to-be-a-floor-the-met-residency-episode-6/">If You Have to be a Floor</a>
          is a truly special podcast episode, more so because it is so ideally suited for audio.
          <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/this-is-chance-redux/">This is Chance!</a> 
          is an amazing story that I'd consume in every medium imaginable. </p>

        <p> A bowl of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudeg">gudeg</a> 
        I had in Yogyakarta is the best food I can remember from the past year.
        I think <a href="https://youtu.be/YD6fvzGIBfQ">You Want It Darker</a> 
          is a good song and 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Emperor">The Last Emperor</a>
