        <p>I am a first-year PhD candidate at Cornell Computer Science. 
        My research is in Programming Languages. </p>

        <p>Before Cornell, I was a research assistant for <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hobor/">Aquinas Hobor</a>. Our work, essentially a large Coq development, eases the formal verification of graph-manipulating algorithms written in C. Fun highlights include a verified garbage collector for the CertiCoq compiler and the discovery of an overflow bug in Dijkstra's algorithm. </p>

        <p>Before Aquinas, I was part of the amazing inaugural cohort of <a href="https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/">Yale-NUS College</a>. I had the honor of giving the commencement speech for my graduating class, and currently serve on the Alumni Council. </p>

        Inverting the Ackermann Hierarchy </p>

        <p> The Ackermann function \(\mathcal{A}\) grows explosively, and its inverse
          \(\alpha\) is of interest in CS. Sadly, the standard practice of computing 
          \(\alpha\) via \(\mathcal{A}\) is untenable.
          In this paper, we give a new and efficient computation of \(\alpha\). 
          We also give efficient computations for the 
          closely-related and better-known hyperoperation hierarchy 
          (\(+\), \(\times\), \(^\wedge\), tetration, ...) and <em>its</em> inverse
          (\(-\), \(\div\), log, log\(^{*}\), ...).
          This development is supported by proofs of correctness in Coq. </p>

      <div class="autoquack blurb">
        <p> We develop powerful and general techniques to mechanically verify realistic programs that manipulate heap- represented graphs. These graphs can exhibit well-known organization principles, such as being a directed acyclic graph or a disjoint-forest; alternatively, these graphs can be totally unstructured. The common thread for such structures is that they exhibit deep intrinsic sharing and can be expressed using the language of graph theory. We construct a modular and general setup for reasoning about abstract mathematical graphs and use separation logic to define how such abstract graphs are represented concretely in the heap. We develop a Localize rule that enables modular reasoning about such programs, and show how this rule can support existential quantifiers in postconditions and smoothly handle modified program variables. We demonstrate the generality and power of our techniques by integrating them into the Verified Software Toolchain and certifying the correctness of seven graph-manipulating programs written in CompCert C, including a 400-line generational garbage collector for the CertiCoq project. While doing so, we identify two places where the semantics of C is too weak to define generational garbage collectors of the sort used in the OCaml runtime. Our proofs are entirely machine-checked in Coq. </p>

        <p> In this talk I will report on the formal verification of an OCaml-style garbage collector (GC) servicing Gallina, the specification language within Coq. GCs are notoriously hard to verify, and Gallina's GC has sophisticated features that pose further challenges. Adding to this difficulty is the fact that we prove full functional correctness (and not just safety), and the fact that we verify real C code (and not an idealised verification-friendly language). Interestingly, our verification exposes two places where the semantics of C do not allow the formal specification and verification of OCaml-style GCs such as ours. </p>

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things">The God of Small Things</a>,

          has recently barged into these ranks. The meaning of this is as yet unclear. </p>

        <p> <a href="https://thememorypalace.us/if-you-have-to-be-a-floor-the-met-residency-episode-6/">If You Have to be a Floor</a>
          is a truly special podcast episode, more so because it is so ideally suited for the
          audio medium. 
          <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/this-is-chance-redux/">This is Chance!</a> 
          is just an amazing story that I would consume every way I could. </p>

        <p> A bowl of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudeg">gudeg</a>

        I think <a href="https://youtu.be/YD6fvzGIBfQ">You Want It Darker</a>
