        <p> I am currently a research assistant for 
            <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hobor/">Aquinas Hobor</a>. 
            Our research is in programming languages, and our main project is a Coq development that eases the <b>formal 
            verification</b> of graph-manipulating programs written in C. 
            Fun highlights include a verified garbage collector for the 
            CertiCoq compiler and the discovery of a bug in Dijkstra's algorithm. </p>

        <p> Before Aquinas, I was part of the amazing inaugural cohort of 
            <a href="https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/">Yale-NUS College</a>. 
            I gave the commencement address for my

        <p> The Ackermann function \(\mathcal{A}\) grows explosively, and its inverse
            \(\alpha\) is of interest in CS. Sadly, the standard practice of computing 
            \(\alpha\) via \(\mathcal{A}\) is untenable.
            We give a new and efficient computation of \(\alpha\). 
            We also give efficient computations for the 
            related and better-known hyperoperation hierarchy 
            <span class="nowrap">(\(+\), \(\times\), exp, tetration, etc)</span> 
            and its inverse
            <span class="nowrap">(\(-\), \(\div\), log, log\(^{*}\), etc)</span>.
            Our definitions are proved correct in Coq, 
            and our time bounds are benchmarked after extraction to OCaml. </p>

        <p> The formal verification of graph algorithms is hard: nodes can be shared
            arbitrarily, so uninvolved subgraphs cannot be "framed away".
            We address this with a new separation logic rule
            called <span class="sc">localize</span>, 
            develop an extensible Coq library to further ease 
            verifications, and use the library to verify seven 
            graph-manipulating C programs. Our flagship example is a 
            generational garbage collector.
            We identify two places where the semantics of C is 
            too restrictive to define 
            OCaml-style GCs.
            Our proofs are checked in Coq. </p>

        <p> CertiCoq compiles Gallina into C;
            the transition from an infinite heap to a 
            finite one is supported by garbage collection 
            at the C level. 
            We get into the weeds of the verfication of this GC, 
            showing how the correctness property&mdash;a form of
            graph isomorphism&mdash;is broken and restored.
            In two places, we find that the semantics of C 
            is too restrictive to define the 
            behavior we need. We suspect these restrictions 
            will hinder future verifications of OCaml-style GCs. </p>

        <p> We identify and explain an overflow bug in
            Dijkstra's classic algorithm. The precise bound in the relevant 
            precondition is nontrivial: we show that the intuitive guess
            fails, and provide a workable refinement.
            We demonstrate the bug and its fix with Coq proofs.
            A paper about this result is under preparation.

        <p> To <del>plant a garden</del> do scientific research is to believe in tomorrow </p>

      <div class="planet blurb">
        <p> Part of the point of doing science is to have your work seen, used, and 
            eventually made redundant. Sadly, at the rate we're heating the planet, we will
            soon have more rudimentary things to worry about. I am cautiously 
            optimistic about climate change, but with the understanding that 
            intentional work is needed from everyone who can afford to put it in.
            I'm still working on my plan, so please reach out if you'd like to discuss 
            this as either a mentor or a coconspirator.
