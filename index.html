        <p> I am a first-year PhD student at Cornell Computer Science. 
        My research is in programming languages. </p>

        <p> Before Cornell, I was a research assistant for 
            <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hobor/">Aquinas Hobor</a>. 
            Our main project was a Coq development that eases the formal 
            verification of graph-manipulating programs written in C. 
            Fun highlights include a verified garbage collector for the 
            CertiCoq compiler and the discovery of a bug in Dijkstra's algorithm. </p>

        <p> Before Aquinas, I was part of the amazing inaugural cohort of 
            <a href="https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/">Yale-NUS College</a>. 
            I gave the commencement address for my 
            graduating class and currently serve on the Alumni Council. </p>

        <p> The Ackermann function \(\mathcal{A}\) grows explosively, and its inverse
            \(\alpha\) is of interest in CS. Sadly, the standard practice of computing 
            \(\alpha\) via \(\mathcal{A}\) is untenable.
            We give a new and efficient computation of \(\alpha\). 
            We also give efficient computations for the 
            related and better-known hyperoperation hierarchy 
            <span class="nowrap">(\(+\), \(\times\), exp, tetration, etc)</span> 
            and its inverse
            <span class="nowrap">(\(-\), \(\div\), log, log\(^{*}\), etc)</span>.
            Our definitions are proved correct in Coq, 
            and our time bounds are benchmarked after extraction to OCaml. </p>

        <p> The formal verification of graph algorithms is hard: nodes can be shared
            arbitrarily, so uninvolved subgraphs cannot be "framed away".
            We address this with a new separation logic rule
            called <span class="sc">localize</span>, 
            develop an extensible Coq library to further ease 
            verifications, and use the library to verify seven 
            graph-manipulating C programs. Our flagship example is a 
            generational garbage collector.
            We identify two places where the semantics of C is 
            too restrictive to define 
            OCaml-style GCs.
            Our proofs are checked in Coq. </p>

        <p> CertiCoq compiles Gallina into C;
            the transition from an infinite heap to a 
            finite one is supported by garbage collection 
            at the C level. 
            We get into the weeds of the verfication of this GC, 
            showing how the correctness property&mdash;a form of
            graph isomorphism&mdash;is broken and recovered.
            In two places, we find that the semantics of C 
            is too restrictive to define the 
            behavior we need. We suspect these restrictions 
            will hinder verifications of all OCaml-style GCs. </p>

            of Small Things</a>,
            which worked nicely as a tragicomedy soup.

            Sometimes a Great Notion</a>
            has recently entered the mix. 
            The philosophical implications of this are as yet unclear. </p>

          If You Have to be a Floor</a>
          is a truly special podcast episode, more so because it is so 
          ideally suited for audio.
          In contrast, <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/this-is-chance-redux/">
          This is Chance!</a> 
          is just an amazing story that I'd consume in any medium. </p>

          A bowl of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudeg">gudeg</a>

          I think <a href="https://youtu.be/YD6fvzGIBfQ">You Want It Darker</a> 
          is a good song and 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Emperor">The Last Emperor</a>
